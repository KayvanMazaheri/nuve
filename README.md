# nuve
Just to make nuve available on npm :|

## Why?
I don't know why, but Nuve API is not available on npm and it seems the maintainers of Licode don't have the intention to do so.  
I decided to publish the `nuve.js` in npm to make my work easier.  

## Note
If you are a maintainer of the Licode project and you have decided to publish Nuve API on npm, contact me and I will transfer the ownership of this package so you can publish yours under the same name ,`nuve`.
